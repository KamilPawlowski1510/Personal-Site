            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>If you told me a month ago that I'd be writing about hobbies and that music would be one of them I'd think you're mad. In fairness that's mostly because you're implying that you can time travel or at least see the future but the point still stands. I've never had a good time with instruments, historically lacked the patience to learn them. I did always enjoy singing and listening to music but I figured actually being able to perform would be left to others. Recently though, I found myself wanting change. Truth is I could be writing about any number of things right now:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Dancing</li>
                <li>Chess</li>
                <li>Boxing</li>
                <li>Comedy</li>
                <li>Magic Tricks</li>
                <li>Drawing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There's this quote from Mark Twain:</p>
            <blockquote>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnâ€™t do than by the ones you did do.</blockquote>
            <p>And I've realised lately just how important that is. At the end of the day, we all only get one shot at this and you lose a lot more by not doing anything than you do by struggling. So even though to an outsider I'm trying to learn an instrument, it's a lot more deep than that. I'm trying to overcome letting my life pass me by and to become someone I'm proud of. It may not seem like much but I can tell you it beats waiting for something to happen.</p>
