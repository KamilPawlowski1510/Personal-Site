            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Incase you couldn't tell by the huge writing above, my name is Kamil. I'm currently studying Software Systems Development at <abbr title="South East Technological University">SETU</abbr>, Waterford. Always had a huge love for gaming and trying to understand how I could perform better, usually by finding loopholes (technically not cheating), so understanding how software works was always an interest of mine. I'm also fond of music, movies, shows and anime. Despite this, I always fell towards the more practical end of the spectrum. I was always good at math, logical problem solving, anything it that direction. I'm trying to find a bit more balance though so recently I've started picking up the basics of music and cooking. I'd blow you away with my "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" on the keyboard.</p>
