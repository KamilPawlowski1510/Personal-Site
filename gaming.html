            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>By far the hobby I've spent the most time on, I feel it would be unjust to not mention it. I've been playing games for as long as I can remember, so long in fact that it predates my ability to understand English by a year or two. My top three would be:</p><br>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Undertale</li>
                <li>Terraria</li>
                <li>Overwatch</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I've spent literally thousands of hours on this hobby (no I don't have a problem! ...well, maybe) and still by far my favourite one would have to be Undertale. I could go on about it all day but in short it covers all bases: a great soundtrack, lovable cast, fun yet not easy gameplay and it has a meaningful message behind it. It's definitely a strange game at first glance but it has character and does what it sets out to do well. Even Pope Francis has a copy (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/6/12105428/pope-undertale-youtuber" target="_blank">it's true.</a>)</p>
